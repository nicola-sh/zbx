These widgets have been tested on Zabbix 7.0.24, 7.2.15 and 7.4.8.

## Host overview

A compact, flexible host summary widget for Zabbix dashboards. It turns standard Linux and Windows template items into a clear at-a-glance overview with badges, status bars, grouped metrics, sparkline history, and quick links to Latest data. The configuration dialog also includes built-in preview and testing tools, so item mapping is easier to validate before you save.

**Features**

- Display any combination of Processor, Memory, Load, Swap, Interfaces, Disk utilization, and Partitions.
- Works out of the box with common Zabbix Linux and Windows templates, with default item names and wildcard matching that can be remapped per widget.
- Add useful host badges such as Hostname, Uptime, Liveliness, Problems, Maintenance, Tags, free text, or custom links.
- Set medium and high thresholds for each metric.
- Choose threshold-based or solid colors, adjust bar height, pick full or short labels, and use rounded or square corners.
- Show interface traffic with a configurable ceiling and unit (Kbps, Mbps, or Gbps), while long interface names are shortened automatically.
- Add sparklines for quick historical context directly in the widget.
- Open built-in Zabbix host and item popup menus from the widget.
- See live frontend updates for percentage and bitrate changes with animated tickers.
- Keep interfaces, disks, and partitions organized in consistent multi-row layouts.
- Test exact-name matching for CPU, Memory, Load, Swap, and Uptime directly in the config dialog.
- Preview wildcard matches for Interfaces, Disks, and Partitions, including items filtered out by your rules.
- Customize the Problems badge to hide acknowledged or suppressed issues and optionally pulse when active.
- Supports all Zabbix themes.
